# ❓ About 
This repository automatically checks for patch and integration updates from the repositorys listed [below](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles#-patch-bundles-urls) every 30 minutes. These repositories are alternative ReVanced patch and integration sources for users who want extended patch sources with ReVanced. The links listed below are used for the patch bundle sources in the [ReVanced Manager Compose](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager/tree/compose-dev). Use these links to set your patch bundle(s) inside the ReVanced Manager Compose. Choose between dev, stable and latest (this includes prerealses & regular releases) releases for the patch bundle sources. The links will import the patch bundle(s) (integrations & patches) into the manager which should update the bundle(s) every time these links have a change in there code. *If you have any other working ReVanced alternative patch and integration repositories that aren't already included in this repository, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles/issues) to let me know.*
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Latest:** The latest patch & integrations with prerelases included. Meaning if the latest release is a prerelease, it will update to that. If it's a regular release, it will also update to that.
>
>**Stable:** The latest stable patch & integrations with does prereleases excluded. Meaning it will just update to the latest regular releases and skip over prereleases.
>
>**Dev:** The latest dev patch & integrations with regular releases excluded. Meaning it will just update to the latest prerelease and skip over the regular releases.

> [!WARNING]  
> Some of the dev-patch-bundle sources will not be working. This is due to some of the repositories having never created a prerelease. Those sources will have "N/A" in the repsective patch-bundle.json files. The current dev-patch-bundle sources that have this issue are BiliRoamingX, Rufusin and ReX.
